# Maramataka App
The Maramataka is the Māori lunar calendar and the traditional Māori way of observing time by noting the movements of the moon.

## Release V1             
We currently provide data up to Dec 10 2020. When you first load the app, it will display today's date and moon information. From there, you can search for a valid date via the calendar, and/or toggle days back and forward using the arrows.

This app was built by Mere Mansell, Jack Tabron and Naomi Joy Smith for our final project on a bootcamp run by Dev Academy Aotearoa. Shoutout to the various people involved with [Healthy Families New Zealand](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/healthy-families-nz) upon which our maramataka data is based.
